<h1>Let's Play with the DOM!</h1>

- The page displays various boxes, each containing a number. These boxes form a logical arithmetic sequence (10 boxes in total: box #1, box #2, … box #10). The boxes are randomly shuffled each time the page is loaded.

- The player must click on each box in order (box 1, then box 2, and so on). A clicked box is validated, and its appearance should change to visually inform the player of their action.

- If the player clicks on the wrong box (for example, clicking on box 4 right after clicking on box 2), the game restarts from the beginning. The player will need to click again on box 1 and continue from there.

- Once the last box is clicked in the specified order, a victory message should appear.

- Finally, if the player clicks on a previously validated box (the game expected them to click on box 4, but they clicked on box 2, for instance), a message informs them that this box has already been clicked. However, the game does not stop; it continues uninterrupted.
